HFSYS PUBLIC_METHOD(CloseVolume)(HFSYS pThis);
// Closes a previously opened filesystem volume object instance, returning NULL.

int PUBLIC_METHOD(IsBlockUsed)(HFSYS pThis, UINT iBlock, UINT SPBshift);
// This function determines whether a given "block" is being used by the filesystem. A
// block is a region of disk space whose exact size is application determined, but it must
// be a power of two x 512 byte sectors.
//
// o pThis is an instance handle for a volume, returned by a previous call to FSys_OpenVolume().
//
// o iBlock is an offset from the start of the disk image, in units of BlockSize. This is an
//   absolute disk offset, it is NOT partition relative. The indicated block may fully, partly,
//   or not at all intersect the filesystem partition represented by the FSys object.
//
// o SPBshift is the number of 512 byte sectors in BlockSize, expressed as a shift
//   amount, i.e. log2(SectorsPerBlock). For example a standard 1MB block has 2048 sectors,
//   which when expressed as a shift amount equals 1l. Passing this argument as a shift
//   value alleviates the need for the function to do a slow log2(SectorsPerBlock)
//   calculation on every call. It also guarantees that BlockSize is always a power of
//   two, and always a multiple of 512 bytes.
//
// Block number and SectorsPerBlock values are an application convenience and need not
// match the native block numbering and block sizes used in the source virtual
// disk.
//
// The function returns one of the FSYS_BLOCK_xxxx result codes defined above.
//
//   FSYS_BLOCK_OUTSIDE - The block falls at least partly outside the partition, therefore
//                        this partition handler cannot determine whether this block is needed (best
//                        assume that it is, unless it falls inside some other partition).
//   FSYS_BLOCK_USED    - The block falls wholly inside the partition, and the handler has
//                        determined that some clusters in this block are used.
//   FSYS_BLOCK_UNUSED  - The block falls wholly inside the partition, and the handler has
//                        determined that none of the clusters in this block are used: this
//                        means that the block can be discarded from a clone.
